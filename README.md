# Bus-Schedule
Creates a updating window of the schedule of a bus for a specific bus station in England. Worked with a friend to create.

This requires the python module requests.

The program is expected to be able to display the schedule of a certain bus station using a raspberry pi attached to a moniter. The program will update every 10 seconds for the new busses. It recieves the schedule of the next bus through a online link at transport for london.

This program may not display properly on larger or smaller moniters, as it does not account for the differences between moniter size.
